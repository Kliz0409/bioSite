        <p>My sister was actually the person who got me into drawing! My sister brought me into anime and I fell in love with the artstyle which inspired
        me to draw and also sparked my love for videogames. I usually try and derive my inspiration from other sources, a main source that inspires me
        is music. Listening to music always put's me into a certain mood while drawing which helps my creativity. I'm passionate about drawing and creating
        characters and worlds that can have an impact on other people, sort of like a mangaka!</p>

        <h2>Video Games</h2>
        <img src="Images/Video-Games2.jpg" alt="Picture of Me!" width="600" height="auto">
        <p>When I was little, I'd always sneek into my sisters room to see what she was up too. She'd usually be playing video games, always in the fantasy
        /rpg genre such as Fallout and Skyrim. Watching my sister play games was always a nice distraction for me and relaxed me as a child. As I
        grew older, I found youtube and watched others play video games. Watching other people play video games my whole life made me want to interact with
        that media. Seeing how others had their own communities online made me want to also have that online connection which I think is what helped motivate
        my love for video games. Today, I play a variety of games ranging from Baldurs Gate 3(absolute personal favorite), No Mans Sky, and Helldivers 2! 
        ALSO, I'm a huge fan of horror games and highly recommend games like Fear Hunger, Amnesia, Outlast, The Walking Dead, and Dead Space!</p>
