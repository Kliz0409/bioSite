         <img src="Images/Tree-Portrait.jpg" alt="Picture of Me!" width="300" height="auto">
        <p>Hello! My name is Alex Mahoney, I'm currently 22 soon to be going onto 23. I'm a silly little Libra and I'm currently going to school for
        nursing! As a motivator to my degree, I have always felt the need and enjoy helping people. So going into hospitaltiy and pursuing a career in
        nursing, with hopes to possibly pursue a higher degree in dermatology, felt natural to me. When I'm not at work, I love sharing and making 
        memories with those that I hold close. Whenever I'm not with friends, I indulge in my hobbies which are video games and digital art. I love 
        tapping into creative fields which is why I love digital art, it's an outlet for me to express my creativity. Video games also play a role
        in this as they allow me to appreciate others creativity! I even used one of my own drawings which you can see at the top of the page!</p>
